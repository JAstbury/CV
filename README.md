Former English Literature geek turned TDD'ing, clean-code loving Junior Developer.

After uni, I was sucked into the world of start-ups in a non-technical role. I had to bribe our techies with cups of coffee and listen to their pains with SQL injections in exchange for them to work on my bugs.

I wanted to be the person to build exciting products and fix issues myself so I delved into coding with evening courses run by Code First: Girls. Completely hooked from thereon, I completed Makers Academy (an intensive coding bootcamp), where I fell head-over-heels for pair programming, test-driven development and learning new technologies.

I'm now really excited to showcase my skills in the wild (and be the person that gets bribed with cups of coffee... :coffee:)

#### Fast and Curious Learner

- For my final project at Makers Academy, I learnt Swift in two days and built an awesome [app](https://github.com/appflare/flare/tree/master) in the next ten.
- I get fidgety without a side project on the go. I need something to channel my energy into so am very happy that coding opens up a neverending curriculum to get my teeth into (right at this moment, I'm experimenting with [Angular](https://github.com/JAstbury/reddit-clone)).

#### Hard Worker

- After my first coding class with Code First: Girls, I rushed home from work every day and worked into the early hours to polish my skills. I'm always striving for perfection which led to my groups winning the final projects in both of the two courses I undertook.
- I exert my best effort at everything I do. No task is too big or too small. At my food start-up job, I spent an afternoon licking and sticking 500 stamps and envelopes when our crowdfunding round came through and I did it with a smile :)


#### Good Communicator

- My previous role involved managing a group of *highly* passionate chefs. I was able to maintain good relationships, smooth over any conflicts with minimum fuss and mediate between them and the technical team so both sides were happy.
- Coming from a non-tech background, I'm able to talk about technical concepts and problems in simple terms. I've just started volunteering as an instructor with Code First: Girls where I'm hoping this skill will shine.
- I work well in a team and am able to gage dynamics, taking a leadership or background role as needed.
